    "## Building a Machine Learning Model: Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will go through a practical example of building a Machine Learning Model. There will be a notebook for each one of the Machine Learning Model steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Analysis\n",
    "2. Feature Engineering\n",
    "3. Feature Selection\n",
    "4. Model Building\n",
    "5. Wrap up for Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is the notebook for step 2: Feature Engineering**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the house price dataset available on [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). See below for more details.\n",

    "## Predicting Sale Price of Houses\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the project is to build a machine learning model to predict the sale price of homes based on different explanatory variables describing aspects of residential houses. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is this important? \n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting house prices is useful to identify fruitful investments, or to determine whether the price advertised for a house is over or underestimated, before making a buying judgment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the objective of the machine learning model?\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of our model is to minimise the difference between the actual price and the estimated price of a house. We will evaluate model performance using the mean squared error (MSE) and the root squared of the mean squared error (RMSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do I download the dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "To download the House Price dataset go this website:\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data\n",
    "\n",
    "Scroll down to the bottom of the page, and click on the link 'train.csv', and then click the 'download' blue button towards the right of the screen, to download the dataset. Rename the file as 'houseprice.csv' and save it to a directory of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note the following:**\n",
    "-  You need to be logged in to Kaggle in order to download the datasets.\n",
    "-  You need to accept the terms and conditions of the competition to download the dataset\n",
    "-  If you save the file to the same directory where you saved this jupyter notebook, then you can run the code as it is written here.\n",

    "2. Temporal variables: year_sold - year(s)house_event\n",
    "3. Non-Gaussian distributed variables\n",
    "4. Categorical variables: remove rare labels\n",
    "5. Categorical variables: convert strings to numbers\n",
    "6. Feature Scaling: Standarise the values of the variables to the same range\n",

    "### Setting the seed\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that we are engineering variables and pre-processing data with the idea that we will find business value in the model and deploy it at some point. Therefore, from now on, for each step that includes some element of randomness, it is extremely important that we **set the seed**. This way, we can obtain reproducibility between our research and our development code.\n",
